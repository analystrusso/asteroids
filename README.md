This is a work in progress game of Asteroids. As of now, there is a score counter, screen boundaries, and when you shoot asteroids, they split into smaller ones. 
I have since implemented a Start, Pause, and Game Over state in addition to the game state. 

TO RUN:
Download Main from the asteroids/dist directory and be sure to also grab the font folder you'll find there. Put the executable and the folder in the same directory in order for it to work.

Planned Improvements:
Add mouse support for player movement. 

Add some kind of physics to improve how the player moves. 

Make the asteroids interact with each other rather than simply pass through each other. 

Add in special player abilities such as changes to the shot type and an area-clearing bomb of some kind.
