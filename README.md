This is a work in progress game of Asteroids. As of now, there is a score counter, screen boundaries, and when you shoot asteroids, they split into smaller ones. 

Planned Improvements:
Add mouse support for player movement. 

Add some kind of physics to improve how the player moves. 

Make the asteroids interact with each other rather than simply pass through each other. 

Add in special player abilities such as changes to the shot type and an area-clearing bomb of some kind.
